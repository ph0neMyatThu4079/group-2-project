## Goal in Context
As a data analyst, 
- I want to produce a report of all capital cities in the world organised by largest to smallest population so that I can support analysis of global capitals.
- I want to produce a report of all capital cities in a continent organised by largest to smallest population so that I can analyse continental capitals by population.
- I want to produce a report of all capital cities in a region organised by largest to smallest population so that I can analyse regional capital population trends.
- I want to produce a report of the top N most populated capital cities in the world so that I can identify the worldâ€™s largest capitals.
- I want to produce a report of the top N most populated capital cities in a continent so that I can identify leading continental capitals.
- I want to produce a report of the top N most populated capital cities in a region so that I can identify major capitals within each region.
